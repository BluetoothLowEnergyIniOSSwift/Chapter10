# Bluetooth Low Energy in iOS Swift

## Chapter 10: Large Data



These are **complete downloadable code examples** from my book, _Bluetooth Low Energy with iOS Swift_.  The book teaches how to make Bluetooth Low Energy devices using iOS/Swift.  

This chapter teaches:
* Central: Use Notifications to know when to send packets of data to a connected Peripheral
* Peripheral: Use Notifications to alert a connected Central when the hosted Characteristic is ready for more data
